The aim of d3-axes is to remove some of the common tasks when creating charts
with [d3][d3]; and to do this in a way that complements D3 itself.

D3 is for creating data visualisations and provides the modules for the most
simplest of data visualisations: [d3-selection][d3-selection],
[d3-shape][d3-shape] and [d3-scale][d3-scale]. These same modules are also
sufficient for the most complex visualisations, which can be seen in D3's
[gallery][gallery]. D3 also provides modules for some of the common elements in
the language of data visualisations, such as axes ([d3-axis][d3-axis]) and maps
([d3-geo][d3-geo]).
The aim of this module is not to replace nor hide any of the above. Instead this
module manages the relationship between a pair of axes. There are functions to
position an axis relative to its pair and each axis will be sized in a common
area.
Futhermore, there are functions for generating grid lines.
